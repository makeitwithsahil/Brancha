It was January. Freezing cold. Furnaces breaking down everywhere.

Tom's heating repair company should have been drowning in work. Instead, his phone barely rang.

His competitor down the street was turning customers away. Tom sat in his truck wondering what was wrong.

## The Discovery

Tom's wife called his business line to test something. Got his voicemail. "This mailbox is full and cannot accept messages."

She checked the timestamp. The voicemail had been full for three weeks. Right when the cold snap started.

Dozens of people called. Got a full voicemail. Called someone else. Never tried Tom again.

## The Invisible Problem

Tom checked his phone constantly. Returned every call quickly. Prided himself on responsiveness.

But his voicemail filled up during a busy week. He never knew because people stopped calling when they could not leave messages.

No angry emails. No complaints. Just silence. And competitors getting all the work.

## How Often This Happens

A plumber I know lost a 5,000 dollar bathroom renovation. Customer called, got full voicemail, hired someone else. Plumber never knew the opportunity existed.

An electrician missed 12 service calls in one day. His voicemail filled up overnight. Every potential customer that morning got the full mailbox message.

A landscaper wondered why spring bookings were down. His voicemail had been full for two months. He never checked it because nobody ever left messages anymore.

## The Simple Fix

Set up notifications when your voicemail is 80% full. Most phones can do this.

Check your voicemail daily. Delete old messages.

Better yet: Set up a service that transcribes voicemails and emails them to you. You will know immediately when someone calls.

Even better: Use a business phone service that never gets full and forwards everything to email.

## Test It Right Now

Call your business number from a different phone. Can you leave a message? Is there space?

If not, you might be losing customers right this second.

Tom set up voicemail-to-email. Never missed another call. The next cold snap, he was turning away work like his competitor.

Your voicemail is not just a convenience. It is often the first interaction customers have with your business. Make sure it actually works.
