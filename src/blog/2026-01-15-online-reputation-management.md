Every service business has an online reputation. The question is whether you shape it actively or let it form randomly.

## What Online Reputation Includes

Your online reputation encompasses everything people find about your business online. Google reviews obviously matter. So do Facebook reviews, industry-specific platforms, and social media mentions.

Your website content contributes too. Search results create impressions. What appears when someone searches your business name affects perception.

## Why It Matters for Service Businesses

Service businesses depend heavily on trust. Customers buy services before experiencing them. They rely on reputation signals to assess whether you deliver.

Reviews influence decisions directly. Many customers read reviews before contacting service providers.

Reputation affects pricing power too. Businesses with strong reputations command higher prices.

## Handling Negative Reviews

Negative reviews happen to everyone eventually. The problem is not having some negative reviews. The problem is having no response strategy.

Never argue or get defensive. Acknowledge the issue professionally. Offer to resolve problems offline.

Learn from legitimate criticism. If multiple reviewers mention the same issue, address it in your operations.

## Building Positive Reputation

Deliver good service consistently. This sounds obvious but remains fundamental.

Request reviews systematically. Many satisfied customers never leave reviews unless asked.

Respond to all reviews. Thank positive reviewers. Address negative reviews professionally.
