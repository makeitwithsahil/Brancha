Tom had 5,000 followers on his landscaping Facebook page. Every post got dozens of likes. Business was good. He saw no reason to build a website.

Then Facebook changed the algorithm.

## The Sudden Shift

One week, his posts reached thousands of people. The next week, maybe fifty. He did not change anything. Facebook did.

His phone stopped ringing. His messages slowed down. The business that depended entirely on Facebook reach was suddenly invisible.

Tom panicked. He tried boosting posts. Spent money on ads. Posted more frequently. Nothing worked like before.

## What He Learned

Social media platforms own your audience. You are renting space on their property. They make the rules. They change the rules whenever they want.

When Tom posted on Facebook, his content went to Facebook users. When they changed the algorithm, his reach disappeared overnight.

## The Alternative

A website is yours. Nobody can change the rules. Nobody can reduce your visibility. When someone searches for landscaping services in your city, Google shows your website. Not your Facebook page.

Social media is great for staying visible. But it is terrible as your only online presence.

## What Actually Works

Your website is your foundation. Everything you control. Your information. Your content. Your rules.

Social media drives traffic to that foundation. It keeps you visible. It helps people find you. But it should never be your only presence.

## The Recovery

Tom spent a weekend building a simple website. Listed his services. Added photos of his work. Put his phone number everywhere.

He kept using Facebook. But now his posts directed people to his website. His Google Business listing pointed to his website. Everything fed into the foundation he controlled.

When Facebook changed algorithms again, it barely affected him. His business lived on his website. Facebook just helped people find it.

## The Lesson

Use social media. Just do not depend on it. Build a foundation you control first. Let social media be the advertisement, not the business itself.
