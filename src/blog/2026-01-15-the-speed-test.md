Carlos was confused. People clicked his Google ads. He could see the traffic. But nobody called. Nobody filled out the contact form. Just silence.

He was paying for clicks that went nowhere. Hundreds of dollars per month producing zero customers.

## The Discovery

I visited his website on my phone. Tapped the link from his ad. Waited. And waited. And waited.

Fifteen seconds later, the page was still loading. I closed it and went to the next search result.

That is what every potential customer did. They clicked. They waited three seconds. They left.

## Why Speed Matters

Three seconds is how long people wait for a website to load before giving up. Not thirty. Not ten. Three.

When someone clicks an ad, they need something right now. A slow website tells them you are probably slow to respond too. They leave before your site even loads.

## The Common Causes

Carlos had beautiful high-resolution photos on his homepage. Each one was 5MB. The page was trying to load 20MB of images before showing anything.

His website also had plugins he installed years ago and forgot about. Old chat widgets. Unused contact forms. Analytics trackers he did not even check.

All of it slowing the site down. Costing him thousands in lost customers.

## The Simple Fix

Compressed his images. Removed unused plugins. Switched to slightly better hosting.

Total cost: four hours and fifty dollars.

His site now loads in 1.5 seconds. Traffic from ads converts to calls. Same ads. Same business. Just faster.

## Test Yourself

Pull out your phone right now. Use mobile data, not WiFi. Visit your website.

Count how long until you see your phone number. If it is more than three seconds, you are losing customers every single day.

PageSpeed Insights from Google will tell you exactly what is slowing you down. Most fixes are simple. Some are free.

Speed is not just technical. It is respect for your customer's time. Show up fast or they will find someone who does.
