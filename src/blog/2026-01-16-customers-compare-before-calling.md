A customer searched for a local service.

They did not call immediately.
They compared.

They opened 3 websites.
Checked Google listings.
Looked at photos and reviews.

## What Customers Notice First

They notice:
- Clear service explanation
- Updated photos
- Reviews
- Easy contact

They do not analyze deeply.
They just feel which one looks safer.

## What Went Wrong

This business had:
- Unclear information
- Fewer photos
- No recent updates

Customers did not reject it.
They just felt more confident elsewhere.

## The Fix

The business improved clarity and visuals.

## Lesson

Customers compare silently.
The clearest option wins.
