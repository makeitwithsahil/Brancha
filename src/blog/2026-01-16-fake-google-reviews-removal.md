Sanjay runs a small restaurant in Hyderabad. He built it patiently. Focused on taste, hygiene, and customer experience.

Over time, his efforts paid off.

He had:
- 200+ Google reviews
- 4.6 star rating
- Steady footfall
- Regular online orders

Customers trusted the rating.

Then everything changed in one week.

## The First Warning Sign

One Monday morning, Sanjay saw a new review.

One star.
"Worst food. Found insect in curry."

He checked kitchen records.
No such order.
No such customer.

He assumed it was a mistake.

## The Attack Becomes Clear

By Friday:
- 15 one-star reviews
- All different names
- All serious accusations

His rating fell from 4.6 to 3.2.

## The Immediate Business Impact

Customers stopped coming.

People searching on Google saw 3.2 stars and chose nearby restaurants.

Within two weeks:
- Footfall dropped sharply
- Online orders fell
- Revenue dropped by 60%

## Who Was Behind It

Sanjay suspected a new competitor nearby.

But there was no proof.

The reviews looked real:
- Proper sentences
- Old-looking accounts
- Profile pictures

Google’s system treated them as genuine.

## Trying to Get Help from Google

Sanjay reported each review as fake.

Google replied:
"This review does not violate our policies."

He filled official forms.
No response.

There was no phone support.
No fast escalation.

## Why Google Did Not Act Quickly

Google relies heavily on automation.

If reviews:
- Come from different accounts
- Are spaced out
- Use realistic language

They pass automated checks.

Human review takes weeks or months.

## The Only Option Left

Sanjay realized waiting would kill his business.

So he changed strategy.

Instead of fighting fake reviews, he focused on real ones.

## The Counter Move

He politely asked every happy customer to leave a review.

He:
- Added QR code on bills
- Put signs near the counter
- Trained staff to request feedback

Review rate improved dramatically.

## The Recovery Timeline

First 2 weeks:
- 40 genuine 5-star reviews

Next 2 weeks:
- 35 more genuine reviews

Next 2 weeks:
- 30 more genuine reviews

Total: 105 new real reviews.

Rating climbed back to 4.4.

## Handling Fake Reviews Publicly

Sanjay replied calmly to each fake review:

"We have no record of your visit. We follow strict hygiene practices. Please contact us directly if this is genuine."

This reassured new customers.

## The Final Outcome

Before attack:
- 4.6 stars
- ₹6 lakh monthly revenue

During attack:
- 3.2 stars
- ₹2.4 lakh revenue

After recovery:
- 4.4 stars
- ₹7.2 lakh revenue

The restaurant became stronger than before.

## The Reality Every Business Must Accept

Platforms are slow.
Algorithms are imperfect.
Fake reviews will happen.

## The Only Real Protection

Build a large base of genuine reviews.
Collect them continuously.
Respond professionally.
Monitor daily.

One fake review cannot hurt a business that has hundreds of real ones.

That is the real defense.
