Customers research before they contact you. What they find determines whether they trust you enough to reach out.

## The First Impression

Your website, social media, and online listings create an impression before you say a word. If information is inconsistent or outdated, customers wonder about reliability.

Trust comes from consistency. Same phone number everywhere. Same message across platforms. Information that matches reality.

## What Customers Look For

When people research service businesses, they check specific things. Accurate information matters. Current hours, correct address, working phone number. Basic details that match across all platforms.

Professional presentation helps too. Not flashy or trendy. Just well-maintained and intentional. Shows you care about details.

Recent activity signals engagement. Updated content, current projects, or recent posts. Signs the business is active and engaged.

## Common Trust Breakers

Small problems signal bigger issues. A broken contact form suggests poor maintenance. Outdated information implies neglect. Inconsistent branding creates confusion.

These details seem minor but customers notice them. Each inconsistency raises a question about reliability.

## Building Confidence

Professional service businesses maintain their online presence like they maintain their workspace. Regular updates, accurate information, working systems.

This does not require constant attention. It requires a system for keeping things current and someone responsible for it.
